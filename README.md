# LearningDart

This repo contains only personal stydies about the bases of Dart language.

Even if I have done some micro projects on Flutter, I've decided to re-start and properly document what I am doing to ensure progress in that aspect.

iOS is still my main goal and of course I am working hard on it. However I decided also to take Flutter on a different level. I understood how practical it could be to help me or my clients get the required MVP and decide the feasibility of the project. And also it is sooo fun!!!
